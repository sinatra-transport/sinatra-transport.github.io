# Sinatra

Sinatra is a companion app for the Canberra MyWay+ network made by locals for locals. Our goal is to make it easier to find route and stop information, offering a fresh, streamlined experience alongside the official app.

While Sinatra doesnâ€™t include ticketing or full routing features, we focus on delivering the key info you need, fast and frustration-free.

Sinatra is open source! You can find and contribute to our codebase at [Github](https://github.com/emilymclean/sinatra).

See our [privacy policy](/privacy) and [terms and conditions](/terms).

Sinatra is not affiliated with Transport Canberra, NEC, or MyWay+.
